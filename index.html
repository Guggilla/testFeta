<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>	The Feta Gobbler role playing game is about immersing yourself in the life of a 19th century romance character. 
    Players attempt to complete tasks in early modern settings as they explore the world around them. 
    The outcomes of players decisions are determined by the will of the game master (GM) and the all pervasive 20 sided dice (D20s). 
    This booklet contains 3 distinct but connected campaigns, each of which can be played on their own. 
    Campaigns can be as long or as short as players want them to be, but the recommended time for each one provided in this booklet is INSERT TIME HERE. 
    The GM has complete control over what they want the setting of the campaigns are to be, but the campaigns were written with a European victorian era setting in mind.
</p> 
<p>This booklet is split up into 8-ish parts. 
    The first is the introduction, which you are reading right now. 
    The second is a guide to character creation, and describes how players should build the characters they are going to be playing as. 
    Part 3 describes the roles and powers of the Game Master (GM), including recommendations to make their job easier. 
    Part 4 pertains to pre campaign setup. 
    Part 5 provides a brief summary of the three acts (campaigns) and parts 6-8 provide more in depth instructions for each act.
